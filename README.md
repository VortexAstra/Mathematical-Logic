# Mathematical-Logic
In the course of the course work, I have solved and dismantled the puzzle "Einstein's Problem". This "task" is an example of a wide class of constrained programming problems. In them, objects must satisfy a certain set of constraints. To solve the problem, I used the BuDDy library, which allows using the method of binary decision diagrams.
